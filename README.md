## General Information:
This project's aim is to examine the connection between GDP per capita and the percent of a country's population with internet access. In order to examine this relationship's development, I've looked at it over the decade between 2004 and 2014. The way that internet access is intertwined with gdp has certainly evolved over time, and it's interesting to see where this relationship is strong, what countries stand out in various categories, and what this could mean for future trajectories.

## Technologies:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.6
- Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
